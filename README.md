# OpenCV Hand Tracking Projects

## Project 1: Hand Drawing Math Solver with AI

This project is a hand drawing math solver built using OpenCV and the Gemini API. With this system, you can write mathematical problems on the screen using your hand, and it will send the problem to the Gemini API, which then returns the solution.

### Features:
- Hand tracking using OpenCV
- Drawing mathematical problems on the screen
- Sending the problems to Gemini API
- Receiving and displaying the solution

## Project 2: Hand Gesture Volume Controller

This project is a hand gesture volume controller system developed using OpenCV and Pycaw. The system allows you to control the volume of your computer using hand gestures.

### Features:
- Hand tracking using OpenCV
- Recognizing specific hand gestures to increase or decrease volume
- Real-time volume control using Pycaw
